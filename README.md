## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-Difference between srcset vs src attributes
-Importance of HTML structure
-Usage of containers when using Flexbox
-Added [picture] element to repertoire 

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```html
<picture>
 <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg">
 <source media="(min-width: 300px)" srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg">
 <img src="images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="crystal bottle surrounded by lush leaves">
</picture>
```
### Continued development

On future projects, I will focus on clean HTML structure. 

### Useful resources

- [Ahmad Shadeed](https://ishadeed.com/article/styling-wrappers-css/) - This site become a frequent go-to whenever I need a visual AND explanation for CSS layouts.  I really love this page and will use it going forward.
- [Grace Snow](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/html-plan-product-preview/) - I found this article while looking for some advice on the Discord board. After reading it, I deleted my original code and started over. I'm glad I did 'cause my code acting so funky.
